        ivy.Array instance method variant of ivy.sinc. This method simply wraps the
        function, and so the docstring for ivy.sinc also applies to this method
        with minimal changes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        self
            input array whose elements are each expressed in radians. Should have a
            floating-point data type.
        out
            optional output array, for writing the result to. It must have a shape that
            the inputs broadcast to.

        Returns
        -------
        ret
            an array containing the sinc of each element in ``self``. The returned
            array must have a floating-point data type determined by
            :ref:`type-promotion`.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> x = ivy.array([0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5])
        >>> y = x.sinc()
        >>> print(y)

        ----------
