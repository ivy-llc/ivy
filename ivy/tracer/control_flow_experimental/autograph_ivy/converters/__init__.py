Naming conventions:
 * each converter should specialize on a single idiom; be consistent with
   the Python reference for naming
 * all converters inherit core.converter.Base
 * module names describe the idiom that the converter covers, plural
 * the converter class is named consistent with the module, singular and
   includes the word Transformer
