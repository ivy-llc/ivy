            int, axis along which to take the cumulative product. Default is ``0``.

            data type of the returned array. If None, if the default data type
            corresponding to the data type “kind” (integer or floating-point) of x
            has a smaller range of values than the data type of x (e.g., x has data

            and the default data type is int64), the returned array must have the
            same data type as x. if x has a floating-point data type, the returned array
            must have the default floating-point data type. if x has a signed integer
            data type (e.g., int16), the returned array must have the default integer
            data type. if x has an unsigned integer data type (e.g., uint16), the
            returned array must have an unsigned integer data type having the same
            number of bits as the default integer data type (e.g., if the default
            integer data type is int32, the returned array must have a uint32 data
            type). If the data type (either specified or resolved) differs from the
            data type of x, the input array should be cast to the specified data type
            before computing the product. Default: ``None``.
        out
            optional output array, for writing the result to.
