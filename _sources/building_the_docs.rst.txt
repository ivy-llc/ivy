Building the Docs
=================

Following are the files involved in the documentation building pipeline:


:code:`entrypoint.sh`
---------------------

This is the first file involved in the documentation building pipeline. 
It installs the requirements, synchronizes the container's folder with the project's build folder.
It is responsible for executing the rest of the pipeline as it runs the :code:`_make_docs.sh` and :code:`remove_docs.sh` files.


:code:`_make_docs.sh`
---------------------

| This file contains commands for executing files involved in generation of the documentation. _ at the start is to indicate that this is a privately accessed file.
| This file fulfils the following purpose:
| 1. It deletes any previously generated documentation in the :code:`autogenerated_source` folder and the :code:`build` folder.
| 2. Then it executes the :code:`generate_src_rst_files.py`` file, followed by the :code:`sphinx-build.py` file.
| 3. Then it deletes all files of format :code:`X.png` from the :code:`build/_images`` folder.
| 4. Lastly, it executes the :code:`correct_built_html_files.py` file.


:code:`generate_src_rst_files.py`
----------------------------------

| This file is the first stage of documentation generation. It involves the use of code docstrings and project structure to generate rst files for the project.
| 
| The :code:`main` function does the following:
| 1. It looks for the submodules to be skipped, stepped into and processed out of order.
| 2. It reads the configuration from the :code:`partial_source/conf.py` file.
| 3. It deletes any previously generated documentation in the :code:`autogenerated_source` folder.
| 4. It copies files from the :code:`partial_source/images` folder to the :code:`build/_images` folder.
| 5. It calls the :code:`create_rst_files` function.
| 
| The :code:`create_rst_files` function does the following:
| 1. Lists all files in the current folder.
| 2. Filters out the submodules to be skipped.
| 3. Recursively accesses all submodules.
| 4. For every submodule, it creates a directory structure.
| 5. Every python module will be represented with a folder which will contain rst files for all its functions and a rst file which will use these files to generate the overall markup for the module.
| 6. Writing the rst files involves extracting function and class names using the :code:`get_functions_and_classes` function, followed by their doctrings.
| 7. A README.rst file is generated for every module and is named as module_name.rst using the :code:`copy_readme_to_rst` function.
| 8. The Table of Contents(TOC) tree is generated for the module according to the order followed and is appended to the rst file using the :code:`append_toctree_to_rst`.
| 9. An index.rst file is generated for the root directory using the :code:`create_index_rst` function.
| 10. If a module is to be stepped into, then this folder structure is not generated for it.


:code:`sphinx-build.py`
-----------------------

This file is used to generate the HTML files for the documentation using the rst files generated previously.


:code:`correct_built_html_files.py`
-----------------------------------

This file is used for further processing on the HTML files generated by Sphinx.
This involves replacing 3.14 with π, updating paths according to current folder, and updating namespaces in the code in the documentation.


:code:`remove_files.sh`
-----------------------

All files involved in the generation of documentation are removed by executing these commands.
