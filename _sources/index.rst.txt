Ivy is both a ML transpiler and a framework, currently supporting JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch and Numpy.

Ivy unifies all ML frameworks 💥 enabling you not only to **write code that can be used with any of these frameworks as the backend**, 
but also to **convert 🔄 any function written in any of them to code in your preferred framework!**

You can check out `Ivy as a transpiler`_ and `Ivy as a framework`_ to learn more about this, try out Ivy
straight away going through the `Setting up Ivy`_ section, or dive deep into Ivy's `Documentation`_ and `Examples`_!

If you would like to contribute, you can join our growing `Community`_ 🌍, check out our `Contributing`_ guide,
and take a look at the `open tasks`_ if you'd like to dive straight in 🧑‍💻

Ivy as a transpiler
-------------------

Ivy's transpiler allow you to use code from any other framework (and soon, from any other version of the same framework!) in your own code with just one line of code. To do so, Ivy traces a computational graph and leverages Ivy's frontends and backends to link one framework to the other. 

This way, Ivy makes all ML-related projects available for you, independently of the framework you want to use to research, develop, or deploy systems. Feel free to head over to the docs for the full API reference, but the main functions that you'd use probably are:

.. code-block:: python

    ivy.compile()     # Compiles a function into an efficient graph, removing Ivy's wrapping and redundant code
    ivy.transpile()   # Converts framework specific code to a different framework
    ivy.unify()       # Converts framework specific code to Ivy

These functions can be used eagerly and lazily. If you pass the neccesary arguments, the function will be called instantly, otherwise, compilation/transpilation will happen the first time you invoke the function with the proper arguments.

.. code-block:: python
    
    import ivy
    ivy.set_backend("jax")

    # Simple JAX function to transpile
    def test_fn(x):
        return jax.numpy.sum(x)

    x1 = ivy.array([1., 2.])

.. code-block:: python
    
    # Arguments are available -> transpilation happens eagerly
    eager_graph = ivy.transpile(test_fn, to="torch", args=(x1,))
    # eager_graph is now torch code and runs efficiently
    ret = eager_graph(x1)

.. code-block:: python
    
    # Arguments are not available -> transpilation happens lazily
    lazy_graph = ivy.transpile(test_fn, to="torch") # nothing is transpiled here
    # The transpiled graph is initialized, transpilation will happen here
    ret = lazy_graph(x1)
    # lazy_graph is now torch code and runs efficiently
    ret = lazy_graph(x1)

If you want to learn more, you can find more information in the `Ivy as a transpiler <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/design/ivy_as_a_transpiler.html>`_ section of the docs!

When should I use Ivy as a transpiler?
######################################

If you want to use building blocks published in other frameworks (neural networks, layers, array computing libraries, training pipelines...), you want to integrate code developed in various frameworks, or maybe straight up move code from one framework to another, the transpiler is definitely the tool 🔧 for the job! As the output of transpilation is native code in the target framework, you can use the converted code just as if it was code originally developed in that framework, appliying framework-specific optimizations or tools, making a whole new level of code available to you.

Ivy as a framework
-------------------

The Ivy framework is built on top of various essential components, mainly the `Backend Handler`_, which manages what framework is being used behind the scenes and the `Backend Functional APIs`_, which provide framework-specific implementations of the Ivy functions. Likewise, classes like the :code:`ivy.Container` and :code:`ivy.Array` are also available, facilitating the use of structured data and array-like objects (learn more about them `here! <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/design/ivy_as_a_framework.html>`_). 

All of the functionalities in Ivy are exposed through the :code:`Ivy functional API` and the :code:`Ivy stateful API`. All functions in the `Functional API <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/design/building_blocks.html#ivy-functional-api>`_ are **Framework Agnostic Functions**, which mean that we can use them like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import ivy
    import jax.numpy as jnp
    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np
    import torch

    def mse_loss(y, target):
        return ivy.mean((out - target)**2)

    jax_mse   = mse_loss(jnp.ones((5,)), jnp.ones((5,)))
    tf_mse    = mse_loss(tf.ones((5,)), tf.ones((5,)))
    np_mse    = mse_loss(np.ones((5,)), np.ones((5,)))
    torch_mse = mse_loss(torch.ones((5,)), torch.ones((5,)))

In the example below we show how Ivy's functions are compatible with tensors from different frameworks.
This is the same for ALL Ivy functions. They can accept tensors from any framework and return the correct result.

The `Ivy Stateful API <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/design/ivy_as_a_framework/ivy_stateful_api.html>`_, on the other hand, allows you to define trainable modules and layers, which you can use alone or as a part of any other framework code!

.. code-block:: python

    import ivy

    class MyModel(ivy.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            self.linear0 = ivy.Linear(3, 64)
            self.linear1 = ivy.Linear(64, 1)
            ivy.Module.__init__(self)

        def _forward(self, x):
            x = ivy.relu(self.linear0(x))
            return ivy.sigmoid(self.linear1(x))


If we put it all toghether, we'll have something like this. This example uses PyTorch as a backend framework,
but the backend can easily be changed to your favorite frameworks, such as TensorFlow, or JAX.

.. code-block:: python

    import ivy

    class MyModel(ivy.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            self.linear0 = ivy.Linear(3, 64)
            self.linear1 = ivy.Linear(64, 1)
            ivy.Module.__init__(self)

        def _forward(self, x):
            x = ivy.relu(self.linear0(x))
            return ivy.sigmoid(self.linear1(x))

    ivy.set_backend('torch')  # change to any backend!
    model = MyModel()
    optimizer = ivy.Adam(1e-4)
    x_in = ivy.array([1., 2., 3.])
    target = ivy.array([0.])

    def loss_fn(v):
        out = model(x_in, v=v)
        return ivy.mean((out - target)**2)

    for step in range(100):
        loss, grads = ivy.execute_with_gradients(loss_fn, model.v)
        model.v = optimizer.step(model.v, grads)
        print('step {} loss {}'.format(step, ivy.to_numpy(loss).item()))

    print('Finished training!')


Last but no least, we are also working on specific extension totally written in Ivy and therefore usable within any framework, 
covering topics like `Mechanics`_, `Computer Vision`_, `Robotics`_, a `Reinforcement Learning Gym`_, `Memory`_ and implementation of various `Models`_ or `Builder tools`_ with trainers, data loaders and more.

TODO: Maybe add small logos in a row?

As always, you can find more information about `Ivy as a framework in the docs! <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/design/ivy_as_a_framework.html#ivy-as-a-framework>`_

When should I use Ivy as a framework?
######################################

As Ivy supports multiple backends, writing code in Ivy breaks you free from framework limitations. If you want to publish highly flexible code for everyone to use, independently of the framework they are using, or you plan to develop ML-related tools and want them to be interoperable with not only the already existing frameworks, but also with future frameworks, then Ivy is for you!

Setting up Ivy
--------------

ToDo: test each one of these procedures in various platforms, add links

There are various ways to use Ivy, depending on your preferred environment:

Installing using pip
####################

The easiest way to set up Ivy is to install it using pip with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ivy-core

..

    Keep in mind that this won't install any of the underlying frameworks (you will need at least one to run Ivy!). We will (very) soon offer support for multiple versions, but for now we have pinned Ivy to specific versions, so you'll need to have one of these installed:

+------------+-----------------+
| Framework  | Pinned version  |
+============+=================+
| PyTorch    | 1.11.0          |
+------------+-----------------+
| TensorFlow | 2.9.1           |
+------------+-----------------+
| JAX        | 0.3.14          |
+------------+-----------------+
| NumPy      | 1.23.0          |
+------------+-----------------+

Docker
######

If you prefer to use containers, we also have pre-built Docker images with all the supported frameworks and some relevant packages already installed, which you can pull from:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull unifyai/ivy:latest

.. code-block:: bash

    ToDo: docker with GPU support should be explained here

Installing from source
######################

Obviously, you can also install Ivy from source if you want to take advantage of the latest changes, but we can't ensure that everything will work as expected :sweat_smile:

.. code-block:: bash

    ToDo: instructions


If you want to set up testing and various frameworks it's probably best to check out the `Contributing - Setting Up <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/contributing/setting_up.html#setting-up>`_ page, where OS-specific and IDE-specific instructions and video tutorials to do so are available!


Access to the Transpiler API
############################

If you only want to use Ivy as a framework you can ignore this entirely, but if you want to try out Ivy's transpiler you'll have to sign up and get an API key following the steps below. Fear not! This is entirely free, but keep in mind that the transpiler is currently in alpha, so expect some rough edges and please share with us any bug 🐛 you encounter! 

.. raw:: html

   <details>
   <summary><h3>API key instructions</h3></summary>

To get an API key you have to go to `Ivy's console page <https://console.lets-unify.ai>`_ and sign in with your preferred authentication method. Once you have logged in, you should see the following page.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillesanbri/ivy/readme-revamp/screenshot-1b.png

If you now click on "My Account", you'll find a "Generate API key" button. Once you click it, you'll be asked to complete a brief form with basic information if this is your first time logging into the console, otherwise, your API key will be displayed on the screen as shown below.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guillesanbri/ivy/readme-revamp/screenshot-2b.png

Now that you have an API key, **you'll have to store it in a `key.pem` file located inside a `.ivy` directory**. Once those have been created, you must define an environment variable :code:`IVY_ROOT` that specifies the location of said directory, you can do this as you normally would in your preferred OS, or you can set it directly within your python script using `os`.

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    os.environ["IVY_ROOT"] = ".ivy"

Documentation
-------------

The `Ivy Docs page <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/>`_ holds all the relevant information about Ivy's and it's framework API reference. 

There, you will find the `Design <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/design.html>`_ page, which is an user-focused guide about the architecture and the building blocks of Ivy. Likewise, you can take a look at the `Deep dive <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/deep_dive.html>`_, which is oriented towards potential contributors of the code base and explains the nuances of Ivy in full detail 🔎. 

Another important sections of the docs is `Background <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/background.html>`_, which contextualises the problem Ivy is trying to solve and the current `ML Explosion <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/background/ml_explosion.html>`_, explaining both (1) why is important `to solve this problem <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/background/why_unify.html>`_ and (2) how we are adhering to existing `standards <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/background/standardization.html>`_ to make this happen. 

Lastly, you can also find there the `Related Work <https://lets-unify.ai/ivy/related_work.html>`_ section, which paints a clear picture of the role Ivy plays in the ML stack, comparing it to other existing solutions in terms of functionalities and level.


Examples
--------

The `Examples page`_ features a wide range of demos and tutorials showcasing the functionalities of Ivy along with multiple use cases, but feel free to check out some shorter framework-specific examples here ⬇

Or you can use Ivy as a framework, breaking yourself (and your code) free from deciding which community to support, allowing anyone to run your code in their framework of choice!

.. code-block:: python

    # ToDo: Change this with a different, more involved example

    import ivy

    class MyModel(ivy.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            self.linear0 = ivy.Linear(3, 64)
            self.linear1 = ivy.Linear(64, 1)
            ivy.Module.__init__(self)

        def _forward(self, x):
            x = ivy.relu(self.linear0(x))
            return ivy.sigmoid(self.linear1(x))

    ivy.set_backend('torch')  # change to any backend!
    model = MyModel()
    optimizer = ivy.Adam(1e-4)
    x_in = ivy.array([1., 2., 3.])
    target = ivy.array([0.])

    def loss_fn(v):
        out = model(x_in, v=v)
        return ivy.mean((out - target)**2)

    for step in range(100):
        loss, grads = ivy.execute_with_gradients(loss_fn, model.v)
        model.v = optimizer.step(model.v, grads)
        print('step {} loss {}'.format(step, ivy.to_numpy(loss).item()))

    print('Finished training!')
