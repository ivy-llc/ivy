Each element-wise result is expressed in radians.

    The mathematical signs of ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` determine the quadrant of each element-wise result.

    .. note::
       For input arrays which promote to an integer data type, the result of division by zero is unspecified and thus implementation-defined.

    **Special cases**

    .. note::
       Floor division was introduced in Python via `PEP 238 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/>`_ with the goal to disambiguate "true division" (i.e., computing an approximation to the mathematical operation of division) from "floor division" (i.e., rounding the result of division toward negative infinity). The former was computed when one of the operands was a ``float``, while the latter was computed when both operands were ``int``\s. Overloading the ``/`` operator to support both behaviors led to subtle numerical bugs when integers are possible, but not expected.

       To resolve this ambiguity, ``/`` was designated for true division, and ``//`` was designated for floor division. Semantically, floor division was `defined <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/#semantics-of-floor-division>`_ as equivalent to ``a // b == floor(a/b)``; however, special floating-point cases were left ill-defined.

       Accordingly, floor division is not implemented consistently across array libraries for some of the special cases documented below. Namely, when one of the operands is ``infinity``, libraries may diverge with some choosing to strictly follow ``floor(a/b)`` and others choosing to pair ``//`` with ``%`` according to the relation ``b = a % b + b * (a // b)``. The special cases leading to divergent behavior are documented below.

       This specification prefers floor division to match ``floor(divide(x1, x2))`` in order to avoid surprising and unexpected results; however, array libraries may choose to more strictly follow Python behavior.

    For floating-point operands,

    - If either ``x1_i`` or ``x2_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+0`` or ``-0``, the result is ``NaN``.

    - If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``-infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number, the result is ``+infinity``. (**note**: libraries may return ``NaN`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` is a positive (i.e., greater than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``-0``. (**note**: libraries may return ``-1.0`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``-0``. (**note**: libraries may return ``-1.0`` to match Python behavior.)
    - If ``x1_i`` is a negative (i.e., less than ``0``) finite number and ``x2_i`` is ``-infinity``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have the same mathematical sign and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a positive mathematical sign.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have different mathematical signs and are both nonzero finite numbers, the result has a negative mathematical sign.
    - In the remaining cases, where neither ``-infinity``, ``+0``, ``-0``, nor ``NaN`` is involved, the quotient must be computed and rounded to the greatest (i.e., closest to `+infinity`) representable integer-value number that is not greater than the division result. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the operation overflows and the result is an ``infinity`` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the operation underflows and the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.

    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have the same mathematical sign, the result has a positive mathematical sign, unless the result is ``NaN``. If the result is ``NaN``, the "sign" of ``NaN`` is implementation-defined.
    - If ``x1_i`` and ``x2_i`` have different mathematical signs, the result has a negative mathematical sign, unless the result is ``NaN``. If the result is ``NaN``, the "sign" of ``NaN`` is implementation-defined.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is a signed infinity with the mathematical sign determined by the rule already stated above.
    - If ``x1_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity`` and ``x2_i`` is a nonzero finite number, the result is a signed infinity with the mathematical sign determined by the rule already stated above.
    - If ``x1_i`` is a nonzero finite number and ``x2_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is a signed infinity with the mathematical sign determined by the rule already stated above.
    - In the remaining cases, where neither ``infinity`` nor ``NaN`` is involved, the product must be computed and rounded to the nearest representable value according to IEEE 754-2019 and a supported rounding mode. If the magnitude is too large to represent, the result is an `infinity` of appropriate mathematical sign. If the magnitude is too small to represent, the result is a zero of appropriate mathematical sign.

    For floating-point operands,

    - If ``x_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x_i`` is less than ``0``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``-0``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``+infinity``, the result is ``+infinity``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        input array. Should have a real-valued floating-point data type.

    Returns
    -------
    ret
        an array containing the square root of each element in ``x``. The returned array must have a real-valued floating-point data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

def subtract(x1: array, x2: array, /) -> array:
    """
    Calculates the difference for each element ``x1_i`` of the input array ``x1`` with the respective element ``x2_i`` of the input array ``x2``. The result of ``x1_i - x2_i`` must be the same as ``x1_i + (-x2_i)`` and must be governed by the same floating-point rules as addition (see :meth:`add`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1
        first input array. Should have a real-valued data type.
    x2
        second input array. Must be compatible with ``x1`` (see :ref:`broadcasting`). Should have a real-valued data type.

    Returns
    -------
    ret
        an array containing the element-wise differences. The returned array must have a data type determined by :ref:`type-promotion`.

def tan(x: array, /) -> array:
    """
    Calculates an implementation-dependent approximation to the tangent, having domain ``(-infinity, +infinity)`` and codomain ``(-infinity, +infinity)``, for each element ``x_i`` of the input array ``x``. Each element ``x_i`` is assumed to be expressed in radians.

    **Special cases**

    For floating-point operands,

    - If ``x_i`` is ``NaN``, the result is ``NaN``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``+0``, the result is ``+0``.
    - If ``x_i`` is ``-0``, the result is ``-0``.
    - If ``x_i`` is either ``+infinity`` or ``-infinity``, the result is ``NaN``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
