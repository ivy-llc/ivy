Contributor Program
=================

The goal of the Contributor program is to facilitate contributors in the community that would like to work more closely
with our team.
Embark on a rewarding journey with Unify by `signing up <https://forms.gle/Fs6WK3GtsmizZn9SA>`_ as a Contributor.
Let's innovate together!

We've created a promotion workflow to help you advance through the different tiers of contribution,
from Contributor to Core Contributor, Rising Contributor, and finally, Top Contributor.

Our promotion structure is based on our badge system.
Check out `Contributor Rewards <contributor_rewards.rst>`_ for more information about them!
