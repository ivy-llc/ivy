Ivy-Lint: Ivy's Custom Code Formatters
======================================

Overview
--------

``ivy-lint`` is a specialized suite of formatters crafted for the Ivy codebase. It addresses unique formatting requirements not catered to by standard Python formatters. While the suite currently highlights the ``FunctionOrderingFormatter``, we're continually expanding to include more formatters tailored to Ivy's needs.

Existing Formatters
-------------------

FunctionOrderingFormatter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This formatter ensures a standardized order of declarations within Python files, organizing functions, classes, and assignments based on a hierarchy designed for the Ivy codebase.

**Purpose**: To bring a sense of uniformity and structure to the code files by sorting various Python declarations.

**Target Files**: Specifically designed for frontends and tests.

How the Formatter Works:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Header Management**:
   - Removes pre-existing headers in the source code based on specific patterns.

2. **Comments Handling**:
   - Extracts code components along with their leading comments, ensuring that relevant comments are retained during the reordering process.

3. **Dependency Handling**:
   - Constructs dependency graphs to understand and maintain the relationships between classes and assignments.

4. **Sorting Logic**:
   - Prioritizes imports, followed by assignments based on certain dependencies, then classes, and finally functions.
   - Preserves module-level docstrings at the top of the file.
   - Organizes helper functions and primary functions into separate sections for clarity.

5. **File Processing**:
   - Processes files that align with certain patterns, rearranging their content as needed.

Integration and Usage
---------------------

To get the best out of ``ivy-lint``, integrate it within a pre-commit hook. This ensures that whenever code changes are about to be committed, the suite checks and, if needed, formats the files to align with Ivy's standards.
