For general users of the framework, who are mainly concerned with learning how to *use* Ivy,
then the :ref:`Design` section is the best place to start 🙂

This *deep dive* section is more targeted at people who would like to dive deeper into
how Ivy actually works under the hood 🔧

Going through the sections outlined below will get you right into the weeds of the framework 🌱,
and hopefully give you a better understanding of what is actually going on behind the scenes 🎬

It's best to go through the sub-sections from start to finish, but you can also dive in at any stage!
We're excited for you to get involved!  🦾
