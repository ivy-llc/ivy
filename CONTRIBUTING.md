# How to Contribute

You can pick an open issue to contribute from our [ToDo list issues](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AToDo), which is the placeholder of our subtasks.

Please, follow the next process when you work on your subtask:

## Steps

1. **Choosing a Task:**

   - Choose a task to work on which:
     - is not marked as completed with a tick.
     - does not have an issue created.
     - is not mentioned in the comments.

   Currently, there are three open tasks:
   - [Transpiler](https://github.com/ivy-llc/ivy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATranspiler)
   - [Frontend APIs](https://docs.ivy.dev/overview/contributing/open_tasks.html#frontend-apis)
   - [Ivy Experimental API](https://docs.ivy.dev/overview/contributing/open_tasks.html#ivy-experimental-api)

2. **Create Issue:**

   - Create a new issue with the title being just the name of the sub-task you would like to work on.

3. **Comment on the ToDo List:**

   - Comment on the ToDo list issue with a reference to your new issue like so: `- [ ] #Issue_number`. For example, if your issue number is 12345, then the text of your comment should be `- [ ] #12345`. You could also use just the issue number (`#12345`), or a link to the issue itself (`https://github.com/ivy-llc/ivy/issues/12345`).
   - At some point after your comment is made, your issue will automatically be added to the ToDo list and the comment will be deleted. No need to wait for this to happen before progressing to the next stage. Donâ€™t comment anything else on these ToDo issues.

4. **Start Working:**

   - When you have finished PR or need help open the PR make sure to follow our PR template.

5. **Review Process:**
   - Wait for us to review your PR. 
   - Every time you respond to our requested changes you must re-request a review in order for us to re-engage with the PR.
   - Once the PR is in good shape, we will merge into main, and then you become an Ivy contributor!
